# emissions_benchmark
The petroleum industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. As global emphasis on sustainability intensifies, there's a pressing need for transparency and accountability in this sector.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive benchmarking tool that evaluates and compares the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance of companies within Taiwan's petroleum sector. By leveraging publicly available data, the tool aims to:​

- Identify industry leaders and laggards in ESG performance.
- Highlight areas for improvement and best practices.
- Facilitate informed decision-making for stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, and company management.​

The analysis utilizes data from the ESG檢測儀 (ESG Dashboard) provided by the Green Citizens' Action Alliance (GCAA): https://thaubing-esg.gcaa.org.tw/industry/03. This platform offers detailed ESG metrics for various industries, including the petroleum sector. 

The raw data underwent a thorough data cleaning process to ensure usability for analysis and visualization. The final cleaned dataset is available for review in the project’s GitHub repository.
